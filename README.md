# WalletHub_assignments
Created two separate test classes for both assignments with their respective actions class. Also created one base class to initiate the driver and chrome browser.
Credentials and url need to be updated from properties file.

In facebook assignment few steps are extra as new user gets the welcome screen instead of Homepage. However, code will work fine for any user.
Framework can be improved more, but due to less time kept it simple.

Both assignments are only developed in Selenium with java and Maven. No existing helper framework/libraries were used in both assignments (testNG and junit framework)
